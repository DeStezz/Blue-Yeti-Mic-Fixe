# Blue-Yeti-Mic-Fix (Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based) 

# Obsolete with Pipewire

fix for blue yeti mic not loading on boot (20.04 LTS)
(warning may need to change some values if you use a 3.5mm jack headset)


## step 1

go to `/etc/modprobe.d` and move the old `alsa-base.conf` to another location like Documents

## step 2 (is optional *tested*)

place `alsa-base.conf` into `/etc/modprobe.d` after moving the old one if there is a `alsa-base.conf` sitting in `/etc/modprobe.d` (some distros don't have one be default)

## step 3 (is optional *tested*)

edit and replace (or even just delete) these in the new `alsa-base.conf` you got from me with your own `sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`

```
options bt87x index=-2

options cx88_alsa index=-2

options saa7134-alsa index=-2

options snd-atiixp-modem index=-2

options snd-intel8x0m index=-2

options snd-via82xx-modem index=-2

options snd-usb-caiaq index=-2

options snd-usb-ua101 index=-2

options snd-usb-us122l index=-2

options snd-usb-usx2y index=-2
```

Use `cat /proc/asound/card*/codec* | grep Codec` to get the Audio Codec for your machine model. In my case I saw Audio (ex: Codec: Realtek ALC233) & Video (ex: Codec: Nvidia GPU 94 HDMI/DP) codecs there.

Go to www.kernel.org and look up the version of the codec, and get the full name of it. In my case: Realtek ALC233 -> alc233-eapd.

Create/update a file under `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`, and add this line: `options snd-hda-intel index=1`, while replacing model with your own.

### Configuring the index order via kernel module options

If your sound card order changes on boot, you can specify their order in any file ending with `.conf` in `/etc/modprobe.d` (`/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf` is suggested). For example, if you want your mia sound card to be `#0`:

```
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf

options snd_mia index=0

options snd_hda_intel index=1
```

Use `cat /proc/asound/modules` to get the loaded sound modules and their order. 
This list is usually all that is needed for the loading order. 
Use `lsmod | grep snd` to get a devices & modules list.
This configuration assumes you have one mia sound card using snd\_mia and one (e.g. onboard) card using `snd_hda_intel`.

You can also provide an index of -2 to instruct ALSA to never use a card as the primary one. 
Distributions such as Linux Mint and Ubuntu use the following settings to avoid USB and other "abnormal" drivers from getting index 0


## step 4

place `default.pa` and `system.pa` into `/etc/pulse` after deleting the old versions of `default.pa` and `system.pa` in `/etc/pulse`

## optional step for people with a 3.5mm jack headset plugged into PC directly

open 2 terminals and type `pacmd list-sources` in 1 then go do `sudo nano /etc/modprob.d/default.pa` in the other and change `#set-default-source input` to your prefered device `set-default-source name-of-driver` 

for example my blue yeti it is called `alsa_card.usb-Generic_Blue_Microphones_2036BAB0DFR8-00` so it looks like 
`set-default-source alsa_card.usb-Generic_Blue_Microphones_2036BAB0DFR8-00`


## final step

this last bit should do the trick. just give it a second after rebooting it is a bit janky.
incomment the `#` on this line and add your blue yeti mic like the example below in `/etc/pulse/default.pa`

`load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0 alsa_card.usb-Generic_Blue_Microphones_2036BAB0DFR8-00`
then
`sudo reboot`
